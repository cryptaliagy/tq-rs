# tq

This repository was originally a fork of a project by [`jamesmunns`](https://github.com/jamesmunns), and is now available under [`cryptaliagy/tomlq`](https://github.com/cryptaliagy/tomlq). Since I have taken over the original project and crate on crates-io, this fork will be discontinued and should be considered **DEPRECATED**.

For now, this repository has been re-created and made available to ensure that no CI is broken.

> **DELETION OF THIS REPOSITORY IS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 1, 2024. IF YOU ARE USING THIS REPOSITORY, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU MIGRATE TO THE NEW REPOSITORY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON MIGRATION, PLEASE CHECK [`cryptaliagy/tomlq`](https://github.com/cryptaliagy/tomlq)**
